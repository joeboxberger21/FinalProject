====================Reflection====================
This was a great learning experience for me, I got to step into game development w/o an engine and w/o any instruction.
I also have very little experience with python, and zero experience with pygame so it was also a learning process.
From previous projects I learned that I should set a reasonable goal, and not expect to have a complicated project
done in a couple months. I still didn't reach my goal completely but I got close, and close enough to the point where 
I feel like it is at least presentable, and I didn't even have to cram. Overall seeing this project come to life was
a fun experience and I definitely learned a lot.
